getopt
======

Package designed to be used with Rscript to write
"#!"-shebang scripts that accept short and long flags/options.
Many users will prefer using instead the package optparse
which adds extra features (automatically generated help option and usage,
support for default values, basic positional argument support).

To install the development version use the following command::

  devtools::install_github("getopt", "trevorld")
